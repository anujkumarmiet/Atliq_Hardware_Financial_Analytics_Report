## P&L for Markets Report : FY 2021
#### The report outlines the Profit and Loss (P&L) figures for various global markets where Atliq Hardwares operates in FY 2021. It covers key financial metrics such as Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Gross Margin, and Gross Margin Percentage (GM%) for each market.

-  **Highest Sales Markets:**

India generated the highest net sales at $161.26M, with a GM% of 32.0%.
The USA followed with $87.78M in sales, with a GM% of 37.0%.
Canada and China also showed strong sales of $35.06M and $22.89M, with GM% of 38.2% and 41.1%, respectively.

- **Top Performing Markets (Gross Margin%):**

New Zealand had the highest GM% at 48.2% despite relatively low sales of $11.40M.
Japan and the United Kingdom also performed well with GM% of 46.5% and 45.1%, respectively.

- **Underperforming Markets:**

Germany had one of the lowest GM% at 26.2%, indicating poor cost efficiency despite sales of $12.01M.
Norway also showed weak profitability with a GM% of 29.5% on $13.68M in sales.

### Recommendations:

- **Focus on Markets with Low GM%:**

Germany, Norway, and Austria have lower gross margins. Conduct a cost analysis and consider supply chain optimizations or pricing adjustments in these markets to improve profitability.

- **Strengthen High Sales Markets with Marginal GM%:**

In markets like India and the USA, where sales are high but GM% is relatively modest (32.0% and 37.0%, respectively), efforts should focus on increasing margins through operational efficiencies, supplier renegotiations, or premium product offerings.

- **Expand in High GM% Markets:**

Markets like New Zealand, Japan, and the United Kingdom demonstrate high profitability. Consider increasing marketing efforts or product availability in these regions to capitalize on strong margins.

- **Balanced Strategy for Smaller Markets:**

For smaller markets like Sweden and Bangladesh, which have decent GM% (40.2% and 34.5%, respectively), growth strategies should aim to increase net sales while maintaining cost efficiency.
These recommendations should help boost overall profitability by addressing both high-revenue and high-margin opportunities.

## GM% by Quarters Report
#### The report presents Gross Margin Percentages (GM%) for different sub-zones over three fiscal years (FY 2019, FY 2020, and FY 2021), broken down by quarter. The sub-zones analyzed include ANZ (Australia/New Zealand), India, NA (North America), NE (Northern Europe), ROA (Rest of Asia), and SE (Southern Europe). Key observations from the data are:

- **FY 2019:** Most sub-zones had stable GM%, with ROA and SE leading at over 44%, while North America had the lowest at around 35%.

- **FY 2020:** There was a noticeable decline in GM% in some sub-zones, particularly in India (dropping to 32.2%) and SE and ROA (both declining by over 5%). NA experienced a slight increase (from 35.4% to 39.8%).

- **FY 2021:** GM% continued to show declines or plateaus across most regions, with India remaining stagnant at around 32%, and SE and ROA showing marginal improvements compared to FY 2020. North America saw some recovery at 37.3%.

### Recommendations:
Focus on India: Indiaâ€™s GM% has consistently been the lowest, especially dropping in FY 2020, suggesting potential operational inefficiencies or market conditions that need to be addressed. Consider cost optimization or better market positioning strategies.

- **Monitor Sub-Zones with Significant Declines:** ROA and SE experienced significant GM% drops from FY 2019 to FY 2020. A deeper dive into the causes, such as supply chain issues or pricing strategies, could help reverse these trends.

- **Sustain Gains in NA:** North America showed improvement in FY 2020 compared to FY 2019. Strengthening these improvements through customer loyalty programs or further market penetration would help sustain the positive trend.

- **Overall Strategy for FY 2022:** Given the overall decline or stagnation in GM% across all sub-zones, it may be time to reassess pricing strategies, supply chain efficiencies, or even introduce new product lines that can boost gross margins.

- **These actions could help Atliq Hardwares regain its previous GM% highs seen in FY 2019.**
